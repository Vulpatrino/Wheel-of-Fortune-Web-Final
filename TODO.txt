FROM JASON:

I worked on button.js, word.js, and gamelogic.js. Please take a look through that.
Also take a look through style.css/.buttons and word.js/getRandomWord() to see they were scaled to fit browser.
When we're working on the other stuff elements, I want to retain the same methods for scaling fonts, buttons, and pictures.


The mechanics of the game should be working now, there isn't that much left to do:

    1. finish gamelogic.js (look for // TODOs)
       - updateHangman()  -> I already made a switch case based on lives (D2L says to have 7 lives)
                          -> update src for the hangman img HTML element
       - calculateScore() -> I was thinking some kind of setInterval function where score decreases
                          -> at the end of the game, lives should somehow add back to the score
       - gameOver()       -> some kind of game over screen (and maybe play again?)
                          -> see final score and see correct word
       - win()            -> some kind of win screen (and maybe play again?)
                          -> leaderboards

    2. add some kind of leaderboards (firebase?)
       - i'll let you guys think about that

From JIMMY:

ALL The stuff JASON mentioned have has done except the database (leaderboards).

      (NOTE FROM JASON: I had already made word, keyboard and lives label mobile friendly)
2. leaderboards (bonus)
